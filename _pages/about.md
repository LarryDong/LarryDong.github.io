*Welcome to my homepage!*

## About myself
I'm a PhD student in State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). My research interests are in mobile robot perception: **SLAM** & **event-based vision**. Now I focus on Lidar-based SLAM for autonomous robots in unstructured environment (especially for robots under intensive vibrations).  

## Education
I got my bachelor degree from School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) in 2018 and my master's from Department of Automation, Tsinghua University (THU) in 2021. I am currently in an extended PhD period and hope to graduate in 2026. :(  

## News
- 2025.07.01 Two years after I switched to the new PhD research topic, my first paper "Vibration-aware Lidar-Inertial Odometry based on Point-wise Post-Undistortion Uncertainty" is accepted by RA-L! Happy and sorrowful, on the first day of my PhD extension, I fulfilled the basic requirements for graduation.  
- 2023.10.18 ICIRA paper "Hardware-Free Event Cameras Temporal Synchronization Based on Event Density Alignment" is published and available. This method can synchronize any types and any number of event cameras within 10ms error.      
- 2023.06.21 A new "Patents" page is created.  
- 2023.06.21 A multi event-camera synchronization method paper is accepted by ICIRA2023.
- 2023.03.01 Thanks to LYC Dalao, a new T-MECH paper was added.
